## Introduction

The **Niagara Text Toolkit (NTT)** is a plugin for Unreal Engine that aims to simplify the process of creating text based particle systems.

The plugin provides a custom **Niagara Data Interface (NTT Data Interface)** that parses text strings and font data to generate attributes (UVs, positions, sizes) that can be assigned to particles in Niagara Scratch Modules. This allows you to display text with the full performance benefits of Niagara particle systems while being flexible and easy to use. The plugin also supports custom layout options (alignment, kerning, line spacing, word spacing), and automatically filters out whitespace from the input text.

## Installation

1. Close your Unreal Engine project.
2. Copy the `NiagaraTextToolkit` folder into the `Plugins` directory of your project. 
   - If a `Plugins` folder does not exist in your project root, create one.
   - Path example: `[YourProjectRoot]/Plugins/NiagaraTextToolkit/`
3. Open your project. Unreal Engine may ask to rebuild the plugin modules; select **Yes**.
4. Once the editor is open, verify the plugin is enabled by going to **Edit > Plugins** and searching for "Niagara Text Toolkit".

## Supported Unreal Engine Versions

This plugin is developed against **Unreal Engine 5.3**, and should work on **5.3 and later**.

The C++ code intentionally avoids Niagara APIs that have been unstable across engine versions, and the included modules and example systems should convert cleanly when opening the project in newer engine versions.

Using the plugin on **engine versions earlier than 5.3** is not supported. It will likely break the included assets (modules/systems), although the Data Interface itself *may* still work. (Not tested.)

## Understanding the Problem

Niagara simulations are inherently less flexible than regular game-thread code because they rely on GPU/CPU parallelization and tight data packing for optimization. The benefit is that they’re extremely fast for certain use cases, but the downside is that parallel execution limits the kinds of algorithms you can implement, and the data packing pushes you toward data structures that “play nice” with Niagara.

For text-based particle systems, these limitations show up in a few ways:

First, the data problem. You want to display an input string, but Niagara doesn’t take a string as input. So in order to work with text, we first need to convert the input string into an array of Unicode integers. This means we need to perform this conversion on the game thread before the Niagara simulation starts.

Next is positioning. To position a character properly relative to the other characters, you need to know the cumulative width of all the characters that came before it. If you want to center the text, you also need to know the width of the entire line. This means we need to do two passes over the input string. Niagara modules run in parallel for each particle, meaning you can't store data from the "previous" particle as you would in a typical CPU for loop. So again, the solution is to precompute the positioning metrics on the CPU before the simulation begins. 

At this point we already have two arrays that we have to precomupte on the CPU before we even start the Niagara simulation. 

The next problem is displaying the right glyph on each particles quad. Usually this is done by storing all the character glyphs in the font on a texture atlas. However, this also means the Niagara simulation needs to tell the material which part of the font atlas to display based on the value of the character. So you need to first create this texture atlas based on whatever font you're using, and then find a way to obtain this UV information either by precalculating it, or coming up with some grid based algorithm. Either way, it's going to require quite a bit of manual setup. 

## The Solution

This plugins solves all of these problems in a clean and efficient way using Font Assets + Niagara Data Interfaces.

Unreal Engine Font Assets have an "Offline" mode that precomputes a texture and the per character UV information, and so if we can extract this data, there isn't any need to compute the UV's or manually create a texture. 

Early versions of this plugin exposed this via a Blueprint library: extract the font texture and character UV data, convert strings to Unicode arrays, compute character positions, then pass all of that into the Niagara system. It worked, but it was clunky, and Unreal has a better mechanism for this.

Enter Data Interfaces.

In Niagara, Data Interfaces are used to interface data between the game thread and your Niagara simulation. They have an initialization phase where you can process game-thread data and pack it into Niagara-friendly data structures. They also let you define functions that you can use to get this data in your Niagara Modules.

Using a Data Interface for text solves a lot of problems in one fell swoop:

- You can assign a **Font Asset** directly in Niagara. (Font Texture + UV Data is extracted during initialization)
- You can type an **Input Text** string directly in Niagara (no manual Unicode array setup).
- The Data Interface can calculate character positions during initialization.

At a high level, the workflow looks like this:

1. Create an Offline Font Asset (see the section below).
2. Add the NTT Data Interface to your Niagara System as a User Parameter.
3. Set `Font Asset` and `Input Text` on the Data Interface.
4. In your Niagara modules, call the exposed NTT functions (position/UV/size/counts) to drive per-particle attributes and render the correct glyphs.

## Recommended Niagara Emitter Settings

The following are recommended settings on Niagara emitters.

First of all, **Persistent IDs** must be enabled to avoid undefined behavior. The Data Interface assumes that the number of particles spawned by the emitter matches the length of the input text (ignoring whitespace if enabled). The plugin assumes you’ll use the `UniqueID` particle property to index each character, so that value needs to be persistent to avoid undefined behaviour.

Next, you should enable **Local Space** simulation on your emitters. This isn’t required for the plugin to work, but emitters default to world space, and if you forget to switch to local space your particles will spawn at the world origin instead of where you spawn the Niagara System.

Finally, I recommend using **CPU simulations**. GPU simulations are fully supported (the Data Interface functions are implemented for GPU too), but there are two main downsides for typical text use cases:

- The particle counts are usually low enough that GPU parallelization doesn’t provide much benefit, and the cost of uploading data can outweigh the marginal compute savings.
- Right now the Data Interface uploads data to the GPU every frame instead of only during initialization. Fixing this is on my to-do list; I had a solution, but it relied on Niagara APIs that change across engine versions, so to keep things simple and compatible across versions I removed it.

## Adding Custom Fonts

To use custom fonts with the Niagara Text Toolkit, you need to create and configure a font asset in Unreal Engine.

### Creating a Font Asset

1. In the Content Browser, right-click and select **New > Font Asset**.
2. Change the font mode to **Offline**. This makes the font asset generate a texture instead of using vector fonts.
3. Select a font from the fonts installed on your operating system.

### Configuring Character Set

1. In the font asset, expand the **Import Options** section.
2. Scroll down to the **Chars** section, which lets you input the characters you want included.
3. Enter the whole alphabet and any numbers and symbols you need. **Remember to also add uppercase characters.**

   Example character set:
   ```
   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()-_=+/?.>,<'";:
   ```

   **Important:** If you don't explicitly specify the characters you want, you'll have a lot of characters included in the texture that you won't need. You want to maximize the resolution of the characters that are actually going to be displayed.

### Optimizing Texture Layout

1. Right-click on the font asset in your Content Browser and select **Reimport**. This will apply the changes you made to the import settings.
2. Open your font asset and adjust the **Height** property so that all characters are displayed on a single texture page.
   - **Increase** the height if there's a lot of unused area.
   - **Decrease** it if the characters overflow to a second page.
3. Keep adjusting and reimporting until you're satisfied with the layout.

### Generating Distance Field Texture

1. Toggle the **Use Distance Field Alpha** property in the font asset.
2. Reimport the font again. This will generate a distance field texture which is necessary for features like text borders. The materials included with the plugin expect an SDF (Signed Distance Field) texture.
3. Sometimes doing this can change your layout, make adjustments to the font height as needed.

### Extracting the Texture Asset

1. Right-click on the font asset in the Content Browser.
2. Go to **Scripted Asset Actions** and select **Save Font Textures To Assets**.
3. This will create a standalone Texture2D asset that you can use in materials.

### Using Your Custom Font

1. Add the font asset to the **Font Asset** property in the NTT Data Interface in your Niagara System.
2. Add the extracted texture to the `NTT_FontAtlasTexture` material parameter on your Niagara sprite renderer. This can be found under Bindings > Material Parameters > Texture Parameters.

## NTT Data Interface

The core feature of this plugin is the `NTT Data Interface`, which can be added to your Niagara System as a User Parameter.

### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Font Asset** | The `UFont` asset used for layout and UVs. **Note:** This must be an "Offline" font (legacy cache type) to provide the necessary texture data to Niagara. You also need to make sure all the characters you want are on a single page|
| **Input Text** | The string of text to generate. Supports multi-line strings. |
| **Horizontal Alignment** | Aligns the text layout: `Left`, `Center`, or `Right`. |
| **Vertical Alignment** | Aligns the text layout: `Top`, `Center`, or `Bottom`. |
| **Vertical Offset** | Controls the vertical spacing between lines. |
| **Kerning Offset** | Adds additional spacing between characters (kerning). |
| **Whitespace Width Multiplier** | Multiplies the width of whitespace characters (useful for adjusting word spacing). |
| **Filter Whitespace Characters** | If enabled, whitespace characters are excluded from the list of valid particle positions (prevents spawning invisible particles). |
